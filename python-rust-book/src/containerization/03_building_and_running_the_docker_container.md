# Building and running the Docker container

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

```admonish info title="Note"
If you are building the Docker image for the first time, it may take a few minutes to build the image.
```

This will start the API service on port 8000. You can now verify that the API service is working correctly.

This is the final step! 🎉 Great work! 👍
