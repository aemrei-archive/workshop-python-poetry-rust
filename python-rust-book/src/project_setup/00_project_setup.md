# Project Setup

Now that we have all the prerequisites installed, we can start setting up our project. First we will create a new project with Poetry and then we will add FastAPI as a dependency. We will also add a few other dependencies that we will need later on. Finally, we will create a new Dockerfile to package our API service in a Docker container. We will also create a docker-compose.yml file to run our API service and a few other services in Docker containers.
