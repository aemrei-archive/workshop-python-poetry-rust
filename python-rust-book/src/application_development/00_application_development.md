# Application Development

We will start by writing the Python code for our API service. We will use FastAPI to create the API service. We will also use uvicorn to run the API service. We will then write the Rust code for our API service. We will use Rust bindings for Python to calculate the pi digits. Finally, we will write a Dockerfile to package our API service in a Docker container. We will also write a docker-compose.yml file to run our API service and a few other services in Docker containers.
